(Getty Images)Up until a decade ago, dementia and Alzheimer’s disease did not feature on the Office for National Statistics (ONS) leading causes of death list. Now it's the UK’s biggest killers.Until 2011, heart disease had been the top cause of death in the UK, and it’s still the predominant killer for British men.Dementia, heart disease, lower respiratory diseases, strokes and lung cancer accounted for 212,000 deaths in England and Wales in 2022, or 37% of all recorded deaths.Influenza and pneumonia is also among the top killers, and the World Health Organisation (WHO) says breast, colon and rectum, prostate and lymphoma cancers make up the rest of the top 10 causes of death in Britain.Dementia is the leading cause of death for women in the UK. (Getty Images)Leading causes of death in the UK1. Dementia and Alzheimer’s diseaseDementia and Alzheimer’s disease is a relatively new addition to the UK’s leading causes of deaths, having only entered the top five list of deaths in 2011 as people live longer.In 2022, it became the leading cause of death, with 65,967 dementia and Alzheimer’s disease deaths recorded in England and Wales that year, accounting for 11.4% of all deaths. Comparatively, it caused just 14,453 deaths in 2011.Women are more likely to die from dementia as they tend to live longer than men. In fact, more men die at every age group than women until the age of 85, after which more women die than men. Dementia and Alzheimer’s disease accounted for 15% of female deaths in 2022 (42,365).Read more: Alzheimer's disease - signs and symptoms (Yahoo Life UK, 5-min read)2.

Of these, 38,730 were men and 20,626 were women.Heart disease - which can be caused by high blood pressure, high cholesterol, diabetes, smoking, obesity, poor diet and lack of physical activity - has long been a top killer in the UK, accounting for between 40,000 to 67,000 deaths each year since 2001.3. Chronic lower respiratory diseases (asthma, sleep apnea)Chronic lower respiratory diseases is an umbrella term that describes diseases of the lungs and airways like sleep apnea, asthma, bronchitis and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).It accounted for a total of 29,815 deaths in 2022, which was 5.2% of all recorded deaths in England and Wales.Deaths from chronic lower respiratory diseases have been slowly climbing since the early 2000s, where they accounted for just 15,000 deaths per year.Death from chronic lower respiratory diseases like asthma have steadily risen over the past two decades.

(Getty Images)Thousands of lives have been saved thanks to the rapid roll-out of a blood-thinning drug given to those with a heart condition at risk of stroke, according to the head of the NHS.Almost half a million people at increased risk of strokes have started taking the life-saving drugs called direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) in the last 18 months, new data shows.Since January 2022, around 460,000 more people have started taking them, with more than 24 million prescriptions given to patients. This has prevented 17,000 strokes and prevented 4,000 deaths.The drug stop strokes by treating and preventing blood clots in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF), a condition that can cause an irregular and often abnormally fast heart rate, but which can be symptomless until a stroke occurs.Around 1.5 million people in England live with AF, which causes one in five strokes.\"It’s outstanding news that these drugs have potentially helped save thousands of lives already and prevented many more people from suffering the serious and often debilitating effects of strokes,\" NHS chief executive, Amanda Pritchard, said at the King’s Fund annual conference 2023.This follows the sad news of Christine McVie dying in November 2022 at 79-years-old after a \"short illness\", revealed in April this year this was due to a stroke.Her death certificate, obtained and shared by US outlets, listed an 'ischaemic stroke' as one of the primary causes of her death, as well as 'atrial fibrillation' and 'large atrial thrombus'.The type of stroke McVie had is the most common, while AF is the heart condition that causes an irregular and abnormally fast heart rate (that people are receiving blood thinners for), and atrial thrombus is a type of blood clot, according to the NHS.Her death certificate also listed a 'metastatic malignancy of unknown origin' (meaning a cancer that spread across the body) as a secondary cause.Christine McVie's cause of death was a stroke. (PA Images)As many as 100,000 people have strokes every year – equivalent to one every five minutes, according to the Stroke Association. While people who have them are often older, Beverly Hills 90210 star Luke Perry's tragic death from a stroke at just 52 is a reminder that younger people can have them too, and this also includes children.While this may seem daunting, learning about strokes and how to respond can help minimise the impact.\"It is vital that stroke is reported on more because 90% of strokes are preventable due to lifestyle changes,\" says the Stroke Association.\"So [we need to be] informing the public that making small changes or checking your blood pressure could help save their life.\"\"It is also important that the true impact of stroke is highlighted,\" a spokesperson says and that \"people know to call 999 and Act FAST as time is so important when having a stroke.\" With help from the charity, here's everything you need to know...Knowing how to respond if someone has a stroke is vital. (Getty Images)What is a stroke and what types are there?Two types of stroke include haemorrhagic and ischaemic. (Getty Images)A stroke is a brain attack that happens when the blood supply to part of the brain is cut off, which kills brain cells. The effect of a stroke depends on where it takes place in the brain, and how big the damaged area is.There are three main types of a stroke. As mentioned, Ischaemic (a clot), the most common, is caused by a blockage cutting off the blood supply to the brain.Haemorrhagic (a bleed) is caused by bleeding in or around the brain. About 85% of all strokes are ischaemic and 15% are haemorrhagic.A transient ischaemic attack or 'TIA' is also known as a 'mini-stroke', because while it is the same as a stroke, the symptoms only last for a short amount of time as the blockage that stops the blood getting to your brain is temporary. Treating TIAs urgently reduces the risk of stroke by 80%.What are the symptoms of a stroke?Recognising the signs of a stroke can help you to access care and treatment quickly for yourself or someone else. (Getty Images)\"It can happen to anyone, of any age, at any time,\" says Juliet Bouverie OBE, chief executive at the Stroke Association. \"It is vital to know the signs and symptoms of a stroke: Face, Arms, Speech and Time (to call an ambulance).\"To help detect the medical emergency, follow the FAST test:Facial weakness: Can the person smile? Has their mouth or eye dropped?Arm weakness: Can the person raise both arms?Speech problems: Can the person speak clearly and understand what you say?Time to call 999: If you see any of these signsThis can help to spot the three most common symptoms of stroke, but there are other serious signs to have on your radar too:Sudden weakness or numbness on one side of the body, including legs, hands or feetDifficulty finding words or speaking in clear sentencesSudden blurred vision or loss of sight in one or both eyesSudden memory loss or confusion, and dizziness or a sudden fallA sudden, severe headacheRead more: Mum left disabled after doctors dismissed stroke as 'high blood sugar'What causes a stroke?Changing certain lifestyle factors can help prevent a stroke. (Getty Images)As we get older, our arteries naturally become harder and narrower and are more likely to become blocked, but certain factors can speed up the process or increase the risk.“Around 90% of strokes are linked to a treatable health condition such as high blood pressure or a ‘lifestyle’ factor such as smoking,\" says Bouverie. \"Everyone has a different risk of having a stroke, which depends on their body and their lifestyle.”Risk factors include:AgeHealth problems: High blood pressure, TIA, atrial fibrillation (irregular heartbeat), high cholesterolLifestyle choices: Smoking, diet, lack of exercise, not managing your weight, drinking alcoholFamily history: You are more likely to have one if someone in your family has had oneEthnicity: Strokes occur more often in people from African or Caribbean families, and are also more common in people from South Asian countries such as India, Pakistan, BangladeshTo reduce your risk of having a stroke, you can make lifestyle changes such as cutting down on alcohol, stopping smoking, staying a healthy weight, eating healthily and being as active as you can.If you're over 40, regular check-ups with your GP will help pick up on any medical conditions that might put you at risk. If you're Black or from a South Asian family, you can have a diabetes check from the age of 25.What treatments are there for a stroke?Getting treatment quickly is key to a better recovery. (Getty Images)There are different types of treatments for strokes, dependent on what type the individual had and what course of action is right for them.“Some people who have an ischaemic stroke are eligible for thrombolysis, a clot-busting drug which disperses the clot and returns the blood supply to your brain,\" explains Bouverie. After thrombolysis, 10% more patients survive and live independently.\"Thrombectomy is another treatment, this physically removes a clot from the brain,\" Bouverie adds. \"Like thrombolysis, it has to be carried out within hours of a stroke starting which is why it is vital to act FAST. Only a small proportion of stroke cases are eligible for thrombectomy but it can have a big impact on those people by reducing disability.”Stroke is a leading cause of adult disability. For every 1,000 patients thrombolysed within three hours, about 100 more were alive and living independently than for 1,000 patients who were not thrombolysed.What are the effects of a stroke?After a stroke it is normal to be affected mentally as well as physically. (Getty Images)Again, the effects of a stroke are different, but it can impact:Movement and balance: Weakness down one side of the body, problems with balancing and walking, difficulty using legs, feet, arms or handsOther physical problems: Swallowing problems, losing bowel and bladder control, fatigue, muscle and joint painThinking and communicating: Problems with memory, concentration and problem-solving, problems with speaking, understanding, reading and writing, and spatial inattentionSensory problems: Eyesight problems, being sensitive to light, and losing part of the visual field, numb skin, and pins and needlesAround one third of stroke survivors have aphasia, a difficulty with their language, which often comes from a stroke in the left side of the brain and can affect speaking, reading, writing and understanding speech.Some people might also behave differently after a stroke, and become irritable, speak or do things without thinking, become very quiet and withdrawn, or lose interest in things they used to enjoy.Another important thing to be aware of is that many are impacted emotionally after a stroke, and experience feelings of shock, anger, guilt and grief. It's common to have problems such as low mood, anxiety or depression.People might also experience emotionalism, which means it can be hard to control your emotions. While it can be hard to talk about your feelings, it can help to talk to someone you trust or a professional.What is the recovery journey for a stroke survivor?Recovery from a stroke looks different for different people. (Getty Images)There are 1.3 million stroke survivors in the UK. \"Depending on how serious the stroke is, the stroke survivor may stay in hospital for anything from a few days to a few months,\" explains a spokesperson from the Stroke Association.\"They might move to a rehabilitation ward and will work with a team of health professionals specialising in stroke to help rebuild their life.\"After having a stroke, the body will need time to heal and recover,\" the charity adds. \"Rehabilitation helps people to make the best recovery possible so they can relearn skills for everyday life.\"Because every stroke is different, there is no set pattern for recovering from one. The quickest recovery takes place in the days and weeks after a stroke. But recovery can continue for months and years after a stroke.\"Stroke survivors tell us that it can take a lot of effort and determination to keep going with rehabilitation. It can be very hard work, physically and mentally, but many people find it helps them make vital progress with speaking, walking and other key skills.\"What should you do if you think you or someone else is having a stroke?\"Stroke changes lives in an instant, but the brain can adapt. If you think you or someone you know is having a stroke Act FAST and call 999 as a stroke is a medical emergency,\" says the Association.If you have been affected by a stroke, including as family, friends and carers, you can call the Stroke Association's helpline on 0303 3033 100 or email helpline@stroke.org.uk.Its online tool My Stroke Guide also gives you free access to trusted advice, information and support 24/7, connecting stroke survivors to its online community to find out how others manage their recovery.Additional reporting PA.

(Getty Images)Married At First Sight star Mel Schilling has shared that she has been diagnosed with colon cancer, after believing her symptoms were down to constipation.The dating coach revealed on Instagram that she was given the diagnosis last week and is due to start treatment in hospital straight away.Alongside a photo with her husband and daughter, Schilling explained how she had developed \"severe stomach cramps\" a month ago while filming in Australia and was initially told by a doctor she could be constipated.\"Fortunately I knew something still wasn't right so I booked in for a scan when I returned to the UK,\" she continued her post. \"On Thursday I was told I had colon cancer and in an instant, my whole life changed.\"This week I had planned to travel to Northern Ireland with my family to spend Christmas with loved ones.\"Instead tomorrow morning I'm checking in to the hospital to have an operation to remove a 5cm tumour in my colon, a tumour that had it gone undetected for much longer would have killed me.\"     View this post on Instagram      A post shared by Melanie Brisbane-Schilling (@mel_schilling1)Fortunately, Schilling revealed that her prognosis is good, and she's expected to make a full recovery, despite having a \"rough road ahead\".\"It will be so tough to spend Xmas Day in hospital instead of being surrounded by family but getting rid of Terry (what I've named my tumour) will be the best present of all,\" she added.\"I just wanted to finish by saying that if something doesn’t feel right, please, please don't ignore it and if you don't think the answers you have got are right, keep going until you do, it might just save your life.\"New research has revealed cases of cancer in under 50s has soared. (Getty Images)Schilling's diagnosis comes as it was revealed that cancer cases among the under 50s have soared by 79% globally over the past three decades.While cancer tends to be more common in older people, the data suggests that cases among the under 50s have been rising in many parts of the world since the 1990s.The study, published by BMJ Oncology, looked at data from the Global Burden of Disease 2019 Study for 29 cancers in 204 countries and regions.Breast cancer accounted for the highest number of \"early onset\" cases in 2019, but cancer of the windpipe and prostate cancer have risen the fastest since 1990. Liver cancer cases saw the biggest fall.Cancers with the heaviest death toll and compromising health the most among younger adults in 2019 were those of the breast, windpipe, lung, bowel, and stomach.Researchers said it’s still not clear to what extent screening and early life exposure to environmental factors may be influencing the observed trends, but forecast the trend will continue with those in their 40s the most at risk.Watch: Chrissy Teigen decided to check for colon cancerThe UK's most common cancersOne in two people will develop some type of cancer during their lifetime. While this can feel scary, it also gives an incentive to pay more attention to possible symptoms of the disease, to help catch anything early, and hopefully have a better outcome.Of course, there are hundreds of different types of cancer, making it hard to be aware of each one, but having a basic understanding of the four most common types in the UK – breast, prostate, lung and bowel cancer – is a good place to start.So, let's find out a little more about the UK's four most common cancer types, and the signs and symptoms to be aware of, as guided by the NHS.1. Breast cancerBreast cancer is the most common type of cancer in the UK, accounting for three in 20 (15%) of all cases in females and males combined.The best way to discover any symptoms is to check them regularly for changes and look out for a lump or area of thickened breast tissue. While lumps are likely not cancerous, if found, it's important to have them examined professionally.Other than lumps, symptoms to look out for include:a change in the size or shape of one or both breastsdischarge from either of your nipples (which may contain blood)a lump or swelling in either of your armpits, dimplesa rash around the nipple, and a change in the nipple's appearanceA lump is one of the most important symptoms to check for for breast cancer.

Prostate cancerProstate cancer is often very slow to develop, so people may live with it for a few years without noticing any symptoms at all.According to the NHS, prostate cancer symptoms can include:needing to pee more frequently, often during the nightneeding to rush to the toiletdifficulty in starting to pee (hesitancy)straining or taking a long time while peeingweak flowfeeling that your bladder has not emptied fullyblood in urine or blood in semenFor some men the first symptoms of prostate cancer occur when it has spread beyond the prostate gland to the bones and these can include back pain, loss of appetite, pain in the testicles and unexplained weight loss.Whatever pain, discomfort or symptoms you feel, it is always best to discuss these with your GP.Needing to pee more often is one of the potential signs of prostate cancer. (Getty Images)3. Lung cancerAnother common type is lung cancer, which is also one of the most serious, affecting around 47,000 people in the UK every year.In terms of spotting symptoms early, it can be more tricky with this type of cancer as they usually don't show in early stages.However, many people with lung cancer will eventually develop symptoms that might include:a persistent coughcoughing up bloodpersistent breathlessnessunexplained tiredness and weight lossan ache or pain when coughing.Symtpoms for lung cancer include persistent coughing and coughing up blood. (Getty Images)4. Bowel cancerBowel cancer is the overall term given to cancer that begins in the large bowel – depending on where it starts, it is sometimes called colon or rectal cancer.Almost nine in 10 people diagnosed with bowel cancer are aged 60 or over, with contributing factors to the disease including age, diet, weight, exercise, alcohol, smoking, and family history.The main symptoms are:persistent blood in poo (that doesn't occur for any obvious reason)a persistent change in your bowel habit (e.g. needing to poo more, or it changing in consistency)persistent lower tummy pain, bloating or discomfort (caused by eating, and may be associated with loss of appetite or significant unintentional weight loss).If you are nervous about speaking to your GP about any of the above symptoms, or any other possible cancer signs, you can seek advice about how to prepare and what questions to ask at the appointment, as well as discuss any other cancer concerns, by calling Macmillan's helpline on 0808 808 00 00.There are three main symptoms for bowel cancer.
