My name is Winson Sihar. In this portfolio, I have included a variety of projects that showcase my business analytics skills.

With over nine years of professional experience in operations and management across diverse industries, I have honed my expertise in data analysis, predictive modeling, and process optimization. My journey has been marked by a consistent focus on utilizing data to drive decision-making and enhance operational efficiency. Equipped with an MSc in Business Analytics from Warwick Business School and multiple certifications in data science, I have developed advanced skills in Python, R, SQL, Tableau, and machine learning techniques.

I hope you find my portfolio to be satisfactory, and I look forward to hearing from you soon.
